      Thank you for visiting Denver Meetings! This site is the realization of a years-old dream to list Alcohlics Anonymous meetings in metro Denver in a user-friendly format. While the information on daccaa.org is great, the creator of this site and many others found AA meeting listings difficult to find.
    %p
      The biggest pain points we are trying to address are finding meetings from a mobile device, and finding meetings relative to a location. It is a work in progress, but we hope that you already find it to be of use! Please provide any feedback or just drop a note to say hello #{mail_to "admin@denvermeetings.org", "here"}.
